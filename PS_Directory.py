Hi there! This webapp is meant to help you navigate through the stressful PS semesters. It currently only includes details regarding past intern's reviews and ratings for their companies, but a lot more is happening as you read this! If you have any suggestions you would like to provide, you can reach out to me at **f20220233@dubai.bits-pilani.ac.in**; thanks so much! ðŸ’–
